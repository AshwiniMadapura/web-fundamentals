                                Many businesses located in the United States have outsourced their call centers or information technology services to companies in India. 
                                As part of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), U.S. automobile companies relocated their operations to Mexico, 
                                where labor costs are lower. </p>

                            <p class="para2">The result is more jobs in countries where jobs are needed, which can have a positive effect on the national economy and result in a higher standard of living.
                                China is a prime example of a country that has benefited immensely from globalization. Another example is Vietnam, where globalization has contributed to an increase in the prices for rice, lifting many poor rice farmers out of poverty. As the standard of living increased, 
                                more children of poor families 
                                left work and attended school.</p>
